# Ensemble ML Cloud Computing

# About

This project aims to build and deploy Ensemble Machine Learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

The dataset used in this work can be found [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) on figshare and has been put together by [Dr. Tomas Beuzen](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/) of UBC MDS. The dataset contains daily rainfall data from 1889 to 2014 in New South Wales, Australia. 

This project includes four milestones as described below:

**Milestone 1**: Getting  the data from web using API, processing it and converting it to an efficient file format

**Milestone 2**: Moving the data to cloud, setting up the infrastructure in cloud and doing the ML model

**Milestone 3**: Setting up the distributed infrastructure (Spark) in cloud and running the same ML model using Spark

**Milestone 4**: Deploying the ML model in cloud so that other consumers can use it

# Report

The report for **Milestone 1**: "Tackling big data on a laptop" can be found in a notebook [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci_525_group12/tree/main/notebooks).
